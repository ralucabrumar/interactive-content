In programming, each **variable** stores a certain value of a particular type. 

Different data types can holds: numbers, letters, text (strings), dates, colors, images, lists and others. Here are some examples:
* Integer: 1, 2, 3, 4, -5, 20, …
* Float: 0.5, 3.14, -1.5, …
* Character (symbol): 'a', 'b', 'c', '@', 'X', …
* Text (string): "Hello", "Hi", "How are you?", …
* Day of week: Monday, Tuesday, …, Sunday
* Date and time: 14-June-1980 6:30:00, 25-Dec-2017 23:17:22

**Variables** can be viewed as containers for data (or named areas in the memory). The data that they are storing can be read and changed at any time. 

**Variables** provide means for:
  * **Storing** data
  * **Retrieving** stored data
  * **Modifying** stored data
  
They are characterized by:
  * Name (identifier)
  * Type (type of data that the variable stores)
  * Value (stored information)

Each of the variables in Java has a name, a type and a value. 

Here is how we declare a variable and assign a value to it at the same time:
```java
String name = "Bob";
boolean employed = true;
int age = 35;
```
We could view variables as boxes that hold information:

Variables can be stored in the program's:
  * Operational memory - in the execution **stack**
  * Dynamic memory - in the **heap**
