In programming, we can compare values using the following operators:

|**Operators**|**Designation**|
|---|---|
| Equal to |   **==** |
| Not Equal to |   **!=** |
| Greater than |   **>** |
| Greater than or equal to |   **>=** |
| Less than |   **<** |
| Less than or equal to |   **<=** |

They return a Boolean value (`true` or `false`), depending on whether the result of the comparison is `true` or `false`.

# Examples for Comparing Numbers

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Programming-Basics/02-conditional-statements/EN/interactive-programming-basics-with-java-conditional-statements-10-13-logical-expressions-demo-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

Examples of such expressions are:
```java live
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
System.out.println(a < b);      // true
System.out.println(a > 100);    // false
System.out.println(a <= 5);     // true
System.out.println(b == 2 * a); // true
System.out.println(a != b);     // true
```

We can also compare numeric expressions. 

The expressions we compare can themselves contain complex expressions, as in the following example.

```java
x / 45 * (y +17) >= Math.sqrt(z) / (p - (x * 16))
```

The preceding complex expression includes literals, variables, and function calls. 

The expressions on both sides of the comparison operator are evaluated, and the resulting values are then compared using the `>=` comparison operator. 

If the value of the expression on the left side is greater than or equal to the value of the expression on the right, the entire expression evaluates to `true`, otherwise, it evaluates to `false`.

# String Comparison

[video src="https://videos.softuni.org/hls/Java/Java-Programming-Basics/02-conditional-statements/EN/interactive-programming-basics-with-java-conditional-statements-10-13-logical-expressions-demo-2-,1080p,720p,480p,360p,240p,.mp4/urlset/master.m3u8" poster="" /]

Comparing text using the `equals()` method.

Two string operands are equal when both of them are `null` or both string instances are of the same length and have identical characters on each character position:
```java live
String a = "Examplе";
String b = a;
System.out.println(a.equals(b)); // true
```

```java live
String a = "Examplе";
String b = "Examplе";
System.out.println(a == b);
```

```java live
String a = "hello";
String b = "hello";
System.out.println(a.equals(b)); // true
System.out.println(a < b); // error
```
